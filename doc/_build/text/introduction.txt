Introduction
************

CAMPAREE is a RNA expression simulator that is primed used real data
to give realistic output. CAMPREE needs as input a reference genome
with transcript annotations as well as fastq files of samples of the
species to base the output on. For each sample, CAMPAREE outputs a
simulated set of RNA transcripts mimicking expression levels with in
the fastq files and accounting for isoform-level expression and
allele-specific expression. It also outputs simulated diploid genomes
and their corresponding annotations with phased SNP and indel calls in
the transcriptome from fastq reads. Additionally the simulation
outputs the underlying distributions used for expressing the
transcripts.

The output transcripts are full-length RNA transcripts or pre-mRNA
transcripts with introns included.
